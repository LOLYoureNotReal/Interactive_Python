# Many people keep time using a 24 hour clock (11 is 11am and 23 is 11pm, 0 is midnight). 
# If it is currently 13 and you set your alarm to go off in 50 hours, it will be 15 (3pm). 
# Write a Python program to solve the general version of the above problem. 
# Ask the user for the time now (in hours), and then ask for the number of hours to wait for the alarm. 
# Your program should output what the time will be on the clock when the alarm goes off.
